TODO:

Main:
1. 

Inventory System:
1. Add validator. For example: when entering the price of an item, the input must be an int, if not then ask again.
2. Make something like a counter for items. Right now, items displayed individualy. It must displayed like this if theres multiple of them
Apple x5, Milk x10. Something like that.

Purchase System:
1. Add purchase system where it takes from the inventory and subtracts the funds from the item cost.
2. Currently the pricing doesn't make sense. We buy apples for 50 and we sell them for 50. Make a system that adjusts the 
sell price. Even better if we can adjust it per item.

Transaction History:
1. Add transaction history where we buy stock and sell items. Make sure it can be marked as us buying and selling.
